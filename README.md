## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Welcome to LOOFT Management Dashboard, the ultimate solution for managing your IoT devices and users. IoT Dashboard is a web-based application that lets you monitor your IoT devices from anywhere. You can also manage your users, assign roles and permissions, and create custom templates for different scenarios.

With IoT Dashboard, you can:

- View real-time and historical data from your devices using interactive charts and tables.
- Manage your users and their access to your devices and data.
- Create custom templates for different use cases and share them with your users or customers.

This app also lets you outsource the dashboard by letting you create multiple Companies and all their data and users will be separated.
